### Hello World! :wave:

Orazio here.

I'm an AI Research Engineer at Nuraxi.ai, where I build foundational AI models for the healthcare sector.

My passions usually involve building or tinkering with anything computers-related. For the past 5+ years, AI has been the biggest one.

I chase learning and growth over titles.
