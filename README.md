### Hello World! :wave:

I am Orazio Rillo, a 25 years old Italian guy

- 📚 I’m currently working on an end-to-end framework for solving WCSPs with CCG-based techniques as a Visiting Researcher at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/).
- 👨‍🎓 I attained a MSc in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), with main focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also love cryptography and security-related topics :lock: :key:.
- :computer: I usually work in Python, C/C++ or Java.
- 📫 You can contact me on my email address oraziorillo@gmail.com.
- :camera: Check out some photos on my Instagram profile [oraziorillo](https://www.instagram.com/oraziorillo/?hl=it).
- I love photography :camera:, cinema :clapper:, music :musical_keyboard:, videogames :video_game:, but also volleyball :volleyball: and sports in general.
- I can't say no to a slice of Neapolitan pizza :pizza: or to a glass of a good wine :wine_glass:.
