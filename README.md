### Hello World! :wave:

Orazio here.

I'm an AI Research Engineer at Nuraxi.ai, where I build foundational AI models for the healthcare sector.

I love building and tinkering with anything computer-related. For the past 5+ years, AI and startups have been my main focus.

I chase learning and growth over titles.
