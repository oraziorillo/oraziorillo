### Hello World! :wave:

Orazio here.

- 🤖 I'm an AI Engineer with a "proven" ability to design, build, and scale machine learning solutions that actually do something useful—because who has time for things that don’t? I take complex ideas and turn them into software that businesses and researchers can’t live without.

- 👩🏻 According to my mom, what sets me apart is my adaptability. Apparently, it’s not just about jumping from startups to research labs to corporate environments; it’s about always bringing fresh ideas and actual results. So, there’s that.

- 💡 What really drives me? The adrenaline rush of constant discovery. AI’s constantly changing, and I like to think I stay ahead of the curve—whether by reading papers that make my head hurt or tinkering with things that might blow up in my face.

- 💬 If you’re building the next big thing or just want to chat about the future of innovation (preferably over coffee), drop me a text. I’m always down for a brainstorm or a random, mind-bending idea exchange.
